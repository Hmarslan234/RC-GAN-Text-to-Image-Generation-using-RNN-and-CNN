# üñºÔ∏è RC-GAN: Text-to-Image Generation using RNN and CNN

This repository contains the implementation of **RC-GAN (Recurrent-Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)** for **text-to-image synthesis**.  
The model combines **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for text encoding and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for realistic image generation.  
The framework was evaluated on the **Oxford-102 Flowers dataset** and demonstrates effective image synthesis from textual descriptions.

## üß† Overview

This implementation extends the **GAN-CLS Algorithm** from the paper  
[Generative Adversarial Text-to-Image Synthesis (Reed et al., 2016)][2],  
and incorporates both recurrent and convolutional feature learning to enhance text‚Äìimage alignment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [TensorFlow][4] 1.15+  
- [TensorLayer](https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer) 1.4+
- [NLTK][8] for text tokenization
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

To install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Datasets
The dataset used in this project is based on the Oxford-102 Flowers dataset along with corresponding text captions.
It has been preprocessed and is publicly available at:

üîó Zenodo Dataset DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17271467

```

## Codes
- `downloads.py` download Oxford-102 flower dataset and caption files(run this first).
- `data_loader.py` load data for further processing.
- `train_txt2im.py` train a text to image model.
- `utils.py` helper functions.
- `model.py` models.
